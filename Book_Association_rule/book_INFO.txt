The provided code applies Association Rule Mining to a dataset of book categories to identify patterns of frequently purchased books. The key steps include data exploration, visualization, normalization, and model building using the Apriori algorithm. After generating frequent itemsets and association rules, the rules are visualized as a network graph. This helps identify valuable book combinations for cross-selling and promoting popular book categories. The insights allow the bookstore to bundle related books, optimize inventory placement, and improve both customer experience and revenue, while addressing competition through strategic marketing.
