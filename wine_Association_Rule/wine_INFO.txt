This script analyzes wine data to optimize quality and reduce production costs while maintaining brand consistency. It cleans data by removing outliers using methods like winsorization and masking for columns such as Malic, Ash, Alcalinity, and more. It normalizes the data and applies clustering with K-Means, determining an optimal number of clusters (k=3) using the elbow method. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is then performed to reduce dimensionality, extracting six principal components for further analysis. The transformed features are stored in a new DataFrame for visualization and modeling.
